The 'No-contradiction' factor is particularly relevant, as it ensures that there are no conflicting entries within the dataset, such as multiple reviews from the same user for the same product. This is supported by problems like duplicated records, unresolved data conflicts, and redundant entries, which can be addressed by enforcing uniqueness constraints. The business rule requiring each combination of asin and reviewerID to be unique also highlights the importance of this factor. Furthermore, tasks like detecting suspicious reviews and generating quality rankings rely on high-quality, unique data to produce accurate results.",
