Null values in required fields and nulls in key fields indicate gaps in the data, affecting its density. The application domain of e-commerce and customer reviews relies heavily on complete data to ensure accurate analysis and recommendations. The business rules, such as preventing multiple reviews per user and book, and data filters, like including only English reviews published since 2018, further emphasize the need for dense, complete data. The requirement for a completeness metric of at least 95% for mandatory fields also supports the importance of density.
